				<h3>We talked to American Public University System employees about the most critical points in their workflow</h3>
				<p class="body">We learned teachers were having a hard time tracking at-risk students and making sure they don't fall through the cracks. We also found it was important to give students a personalized learning plan so all their classes were working towards and overall goal. And yes, sometimes meetings included babies and dogs.</p>

				<h3>We reviewed sketched wireframes of the application internally</h3>
				<p class="body">I sketched out user flows for students taking online classes and teachers, faculty, and mentors tracking their progress. I presented the wireframes to our team and made changes based on their feedback.</p>

				<h3>We presented desktop and mobile mockups to APUS staff and made changes based on their feedback</h3>
				<p class="body">I created mockups in Photoshop and used Google Hangouts to present the different experiences to APUS stakeholders. They provided me with their key metrics and indicators and we adjusted the interface to meet their needs.</p>

				<h3>I traveled to Pune, India and worked with our engineering team to turn the designs into working code</h3>
				<p class="body">We had worked remotely with our engineering team up until this point, but for this development sprint, we thought it would be essential to work together in-person. This allowed us to communicate clearly and build the collective ownership of our goals. I spent a month working in their office, helping engineers interpret the mockups, editing CSS, and testing early versions of the product on different devices and browser versions.</p>

				<h3>APUS staff now use the Learning Relationship Manager to track the success of over 20,000 students</h3>
				<p class="body">After the development and QA process was complete, we onboarded APUS students onto the site and they used our technology to manage the entirety of their online educaiton experience. We set up regular meetings with staff and stakeholders to get feedback and make adjustments as students progressed.</p>
