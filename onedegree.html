		<h6 class="header-black">One Degree had built a best-in-class social service database, but users were having a hard time navigating the site</h6>
		<p>One Degree's mission is to connect people with the resources they need to overcome poverty. When I joined, they had already made incredible progress with just the two co-founders. My job was to make their social service data accessible by anyone, anywhere – from a smartphone to a library computer.</p>
		<br>
		<br>
		<br>
		<h2 class="center">Target Audiences</h2>
		<p>1. Families searching for social services</p>
		<p>2. Social workers referring resources to their clients and tracking their status</p>
		<p>3. Service providers listing their resources and tracking client status</p>

				<h3>We ran a usability study to see what the biggest pain-points were in the user experience</h3>
				<p class="body">I used the live site to conduct usability studies with 5 community members and used the results to make a priotized plan for improving the user experience. We immediately made a few changes to the existing site, then started preparting for a design overhaul.</p>

				<h3>I conducted a team session to map out the touchpoints and interactions with users</h3>
				<p class="body">To better understand all the ways One Degree interacted with different audiences, I created a user experience map of how users were introduced to the organization, solved a problem or got value from the interaction, and then repeated this for a long-term relationship. This led to a key new metric: The Indicator of Access, or proof that a member had accessed services.</p>

				<h3>I presented wireframes and mockups of the site to our team and iterated after each round of feedback</h3>
				<p class="body">With the results of the usability study and a new understanding of our user funnel and goals, I drew wireframes, built mockups in Sketch, and walked our team through the different experiences. After a few rounds of refinement, the engineers began coding the back-end while I prepared to get external feedback.</p>

				<h3>We went to community events to do user testing with a clickable prototype of the new designs</h3>
				<p class="body">I used InVision to create clickable prototypes of the mockups, both mobile and desktop, and drafted questions for a usability study. I met with 5 community members and 5 nonprofit professionals and asked them to complete different tasks on the prototype. I noted where they were successful and where they encountered difficulties.</p>

				<h3>I used the prototypes to communicate the designs to the engineers and guide the QA process</h3>
				<p class="body">After making improvements from the usability studies, I created internal prototypes to communicate different user flows to the engineering team. I also made a CSS guide that would help us create a consistent front-end style. When they had made a first pass, I helped refine the CSS and tested the key user flowers on different browser versions and devices.</p>

				<h3>We invited social workers and community members from all over the Bay Area for a launch party at our office</h3>

				<h3>Over 8,000 people now rely on One Degree to access resources every month</h3>
				<p class="body">In the year we launched the new site, One Degree's membership doubled from 3,356 to 6,6602 members. 91,906 unique people used the site, a 139% increase from the previous year. We continued to add and refine features, like a new referral tool for case managers.</p>
