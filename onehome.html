		<h6 class="header-black">Finding and applying for affordable housing can be difficult and confusing</h6>
		<p>One Home is a free, nonprofit website that makes it easy to find affordable housing. Anyone can find a home they're eligible for, share housing information with others, and download housing applications.</p>
		<p>One Degree and Compass Family services teamed up to dramatically improve the way people find and apply for affordable housing in the Bay Area. By appling One Degree's tech experties to bring efficiency to the search and application process, we save families precious time and resources. And by using Compass Family Service's trusted data as the backbone, families can rest assured they are searching the most accurate and reliable inormation.</p>
		<p>Low-income families on average apply to 40 affordable housing properties at a time, according to data from Compass Family Services. This require tham to travel to far-flung offices to pick up paper applications, fill out dozens of documents, and navigate complicated eligibility requirements.</p>
		<p>“Families, their case managers and agencies who specialize in locating and securing affordable housing for their clients can actually see what’s currently out there and fill out housing applications directly from One Home,” she said.</p>
		<br>
		<br>
		<h6 class="header-black">“We’re very excited about One Home. We’re literally going from piecemealing static housing lists every month to a search engine with an interactive map showing up-to-date availability of affordable housing in the area”</h6>
		<p class="center">– Erica Kisch, Executive Director of Compass Family Services</p>
		<br>
		<br>
		<h2 class="center">Target Audience</h2>
		<p>1. Families searching for below-market housing</p>
		<p>2. Social workers searching and tracking applications for their clients</p>
		<p>3. Property owners listing their units and applications</p>

				<p class="tags">6. Results & follow-up</p>
				<h3>In the first 6 months, 5,000 housing applications were downloaded</h3>
				<p class="body">Since launch, over 10,000 people have used the site to make almost 40,000 searches for affordable housing. While this represents a staggering number of people for a brand new website, and there’s a healthy 45% return rate, what’s most exciting to us is not just that people are using the site, but that they’re using it to take the next steps to apply for housing.</p>
				<p class="body">For instance, people have downloaded over 5,000 applications for affordable housing properties through One Home. Not all our listings have applications to download (some must be picked up in person or filled out on their own website), so this represents only a fraction of the applications that have been accessed.</p>
				<p class="body">Others are using One Home to track and improve the application process for themselves, their families, and their clients. People have bookmarked or downloaded property listing information to use offline over 2,000 times.</p>
				<p class="body">“Our clients who come into the office for help with their housing search sit alongside their case manager to use One Home to explore neighborhoods, look into individual units and get other referrals and housing leads that they can follow on their own time.” - Compass Case Manager</p>
