		<h6 class="header-black">Families looking for affordable housing didn't have reliable information on open units, eligibility requirements, or application steps</h6>
		<p>One Degree and Compass Family Services partnered to create <a href="http://www.onehomebayarea.com/" target="_blank">One Home</a>, a free nonprofit website where anyone can find a home they're eligible for, share housing information with others, and download housing applications.</p>
		<br>
		<br>
		<h2 class="center">Target Audience</h2>
		<p>1. Low-income families searching and applying for affordable housing</p>
		<p>2. Social workers searching and tracking applications for their clients</p>
		<p>3. Property owners listing their available units and applications</p>

				<p class="tags">1. Research</p>
				<h3>We interviewed Compass staff about their monthly affordable housing lists</h3>
				<p class="body">Compass housing specialists created a PDF every month with the details of available affordable units. They called housing providers directly and entered the data manually. These lists were used by dozens of other Bay Area organizations and were known for the accuracy. However, once published, the lists were static, impossible to search and refine, and didn't reflect the latest information.</p>

				<h3>I drew wireframes for the housing search process and got feedback from my team</h3>
				<p class="body">I already had the data structure from Compass's existing lists, so I reserched a few other housing sites, and sketched out wireframes of how someone could search, find and apply for housing.</p>

				<h3>I created a clickable prototype and ran usability studies with Compass staff and clients</h3>
				<p class="body">Once the wireframes had been refined, I created mockups and used Invision to make a clickable prototype of the desktop and mobile site. I then conducted usability studies with 5 community members and 5 case workers.</p>

				<h3>I used the prototypes to communicate the designs to the engineers and guide the QA process</h3>
				<p class="body">After making a few tweaks from the usability studies, I shared the prototype with our engineering and team and communicated a CSS style structure. They made a first pass using the Bootstrap framework, then I checked out a branch of code and made refinements to the CSS. Once we had a working MVP, we began testing the site on a variety of different devices and browser versions.</p>

				<p class="tags">5. Launch</p>
				<h3>We launched the site, held trainings for Compass staff, and scheduled regular check-in's for feedback</h3>
				<p class="body">Zendesk invited us to announce the site at a gathering of local nonprofits, businesses, and press, and was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2015/09/09/onehome/">covered by TechCrunch.</a> Afterwards, we held several Compass staff and community member trainings at the Twitter NeighborNest. We also met routinely with Compass housing specialists to get feedback and make changes accordingly.</p>

				<p class="tags">6. Results & follow-up</p>
				<h3>Over 21,400 housing applications have been downloaded since launch – that's 1,500 per month</h3>
				<p class="body">Many properties have applications that must be picked up in person, so that represents only a fraction of the total applications accessed. 20,000 people have made over 70,000 searches with a 45% return rate. Compass staff said the site has saved them and their clients countless hours of time.</p>
