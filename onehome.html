		<h6 class="header-black">Finding and applying for affordable housing can be difficult and confusing</h6>
		<p>One Home is a free, nonprofit website that makes it easy to find affordable housing. Anyone can find a home they're eligible for, share housing information with others, and download housing applications.</p>
		<p>One Degree and Compass Family services teamed up to dramatically improve the way people find and apply for affordable housing in the Bay Area. By appling One Degree's tech experties to bring efficiency to the search and application process, we save families precious time and resources. And by using Compass Family Service's trusted data as the backbone, families can rest assured they are searching the most accurate and reliable inormation.</p>
		<p>Low-income families on average apply to 40 affordable housing properties at a time, according to data from Compass Family Services. This require tham to travel to far-flung offices to pick up paper applications, fill out dozens of documents, and navigate complicated eligibility requirements.</p>
		<p>“Families, their case managers and agencies who specialize in locating and securing affordable housing for their clients can actually see what’s currently out there and fill out housing applications directly from One Home,” she said.</p>
		<br>
		<br>
		<h2 class="center">Target Audience</h2>
		<p>1. Low-income families searching for affordable housing</p>
		<p>2. Social workers searching and tracking applications for their clients</p>
		<p>3. Property owners listing their units and applications</p>

				<p class="tags">1. Research</p>
				<h3>We interviewed Compass staff about their monthly affordable housing lists</h3>
				<p class="body">Compass housing specialists created a PDF every month with the details of available affordable units. They called housing providers directly and entered the data manually. These lists were used by dozens of other Bay Area organizations and were known for the accuracy. However, once published, the lists were static, impossible to search and refine, and didn't reflect the latest information.</p>

				<h3>I drew wireframes for the housing search process and got feedback from my team</h3>
				<p class="body">I already had the data structure from Compass's existing lists, so I reserched a few other housing sites, and sketched out wireframes of how someone could search, find and apply for housing.</p>

				<h3>I created a clickable prototype and ran usability studies with Compass staff and clients</h3>
				<p class="body">Once the wireframes had been refined, I created mockups and used Invision to make a clickable prototype of the desktop and mobile site. I then conducted usability studies with 5 community members and 5 case workers.</p>

				<h3>I used the prototypes to communicate the designs to the engineers and guide the QA process</h3>
				<p class="body">After making a few tweaks from the usability studies, I shared the prototype with our engineering and team and communicated a CSS style structure. They made a first pass using the Bootstrap framework, then I checked out a branch of code and made refinements to the CSS. Once we had a working MVP, we began testing the site on a variety of different devices and browser versions.</p>

				<h3>We launched the site, held trainings for Compass staff, and scheduled regular check-in's for feedback</h3>
				<p class="body">Zendesk invited us to announce the site at a gathering of local nonprofits, businesses, and press, and was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2015/09/09/onehome/">covered by TechCrunch.</a> Afterwards, we held several Compass staff and community member trainings at the Twitter NeighborNest. We also met routinely with Compass housing specialists to get feedback and make changes accordingly.</p>

				<p class="tags">6. Results & follow-up</p>
				<h3>Over 21,400 housing applications have been downloaded since launch – that's 1,500 per month.</h3>
				<p class="body">There’s a healthy 45% return rate, what’s most exciting to us is not just that people are using the site, but that they’re using it to take the next steps to apply for housing.</p>
				<p class="body">Not all our listings have applications to download (some must be picked up in person or filled out on their own website), so this represents only a fraction of the applications that have been accessed.</p>
				<p class="body">Others are using One Home to track and improve the application process for themselves, their families, and their clients. People have bookmarked or downloaded property listing information to use offline over 2,000 times.</p>
				<p class="body">20,000 people have made over 70,000 searches.</p>
